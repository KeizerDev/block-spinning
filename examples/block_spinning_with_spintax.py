Block {spinning|re writing|rewriting|re-writing} is a {new|brand-new|completely new} {way of|approach to|method of|method for} {spinning|re writing|rewriting|re-writing} {that|which} takes the pain {out of|out-of} the {old|outdated|traditional} {and|and also|and very} {tedious|boring|dull|monotonous|exhausting} {way of|approach to|method of|method for} {spinning|re writing|rewriting|re-writing} {text|articles}.
The block {spinning|re writing|rewriting|re-writing} {format|syntax} {introduced|released|launched|created} by Autofill Magic makes {writing|creating|producing} {complex|complicated|advanced|puzzling} spun {text|articles} {a lot|much|a great deal|a whole lot|a-lot} {easier|smoother|less complicated|less difficult}.
{If you want|If you'd like|If you would like} to {save|truly save|save your self|save lots of|save yourself} time {and|and also} {be more|be much more|become more|be} {effective|productive} {when you|whenever you} {spin|rewrite|re-write} {articles|content|text} then {read on|continue reading|keep reading} - {there is a|there's a|there exists a|there is now a} {new|brand-new|completely new} {and|and also} {better|superior} {way of|approach to|method of|method for} {during|dealing with} {it|this}.

{Block spinning|The block spining format} have {many|several|numerous|a lot of} {qualities|advantages} over the {old|traditional} and outdated {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning}.
{Compared to|In comparison to|When compared with|In comparison with} the {old|traditional} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning}, {block spinning|the block spinning format} is {better|superior} in {so many|numerous|a lot of|any number of} {ways|aspects}.
{Traditional|Conventional|Standard} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning} can {create|produce|generate} {great results|good results} {but|however|nonetheless|nevertheless} {block spinning|the block spinning format} are taking {spinning|rewriting|re-writing|randomization} to a hole {new|brand-new} {level|stage}.
#s#
{The first|The very first|The initial} thing {you will|you'll|you are going to|you may} {notice|discover|see|find|learn} {is that|is the fact that} {the block spinning format|block spinning} is {much easier|easier|much simpler|simpler} to read and {edit|modify|revise}.
{Unlike|In contrast to|As opposed to} {normal|regular|standard|traditional} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning}, the block {spinning|re-writing|rewriting} {format|design|syntax} {is very|is extremely|is quite} {easy to|simple to|easy-to} {edit|modify|revise} and {maintain|update}.
{It is|It's} {well know|well-know} that {traditional|conventional|classic|standard} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning} is {hard to|difficult to|tough to} read. Block {spinning|rewriting} is {nothing like|not like} that and {are very|are extremely} {easy to|simple to|easy-to} read and {write|produce|generate|compose}.
#s#
The {level of|degree of} {uniqueness|originality} is also {much higher|greater|higher|better} than the one {achieved|accomplished|attained|reached} {with|using} {traditional|conventional|classic|standard} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning}.
{On top of that|Better yet|Better still} {you can get|you will get} a {better|greater|higher} {level of|degree of} {uniqueness|originality} {when you|If you} {use|utilize} block {spinning|rewriting}.
The {new|brand-new} {features of|options that come with} block {spinning|rewriting} will {insure|ensure} {that your|that the|your} {article|text} {will be|is} both uniques and {readable|understandable|viewable|watchable}.

{One of|Among} the most {frustrating|irritating} and annoying things about {multi-level|multi level|multilevel} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning} {is that|is the fact that} {is very|is extremely|is quite} {hard to|difficult to|tough to} read.
{It is|It's} a {well known|well-known} {fact|truth|reality} by {article writers|writers|authors|editors} that the {old|traditional} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning} with {several|many|numerous} levels are {near|close to|close} {impossible|hopeless|unbearable} to read.
The {old|traditional} {way of|approach to|way for|method of} {writing|creating|composing} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning} on both paragraph, sentence and {word|phrase} level is a real {mess|chaos} {to look at|to gaze at} and {edit|modify|revise}.
#s#
{Errors|Mistakes|Faults} {will often|usually} {occur|take place|arise} and {break|crack} the {output|result}.
{It is|It's} {almost|nearly|practically|virtually} impossible {to avoid|to prevent} {errors|mistakes|faults} {since|because|given that} the {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning} {can|can often} {reach|go to} an {overwhelming|frustrating|daunting} {complexity|sophistication|clutter}.
{It is|It's} more a rule than an exception that {typos|keyboard typos} and {errors|mistakes|faults} {sneak|creep} in when you {build up|develop|produce|build-up} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning}.
#s#
{On top of that|More over|Furthermore} {it is|It's} {very hard|very difficult|quite difficult|really difficult} {to find|to locate|to discover} the {errors|mistakes|faults} and correct them {when you|When you|Once you|If you|Whenever you} {realize that|understand that} {they are|they're|they may be} there.
{Correcting|Fixing|Repairing} the {errors|mistakes|faults} {can be|is} a real {pain|nightmare} {since it|because it|as it} {is not|isn't|just isn't|is just not} {easy to|simple to|easy-to} {find|navigate} your way {around|about} a {heavy|large|complex} spun {text|article}.
{It is|It's} {often|usually|typically} {hard to|difficult to|tough to} {find|discover|locate|uncover} and correct the {errors|mistakes|faults} in the {sometimes|often} {gigantic|huge|massive|big} and {complex|complicated|puzzling} {block_spinning|spinning syntax|bracket block_spinning} {texts|scripts|programs|texting}.
#s#
{Block spinning|The block spinning format} makes this a {lot|ton} {easier|simpler|smoother} by {keeping|presenting} everything {much more|a lot more|far more|more} {organized|structured|arranged} and {readable|understandable}.
{With|Using} {block spinning|the block spinning format} {you have|you've|you've got} {every|each|each and every|every single} paragraph in a {well|properly|nicely} {structured|organized|arranged} order and {every|each|each and every|every single} sentence on {its own|an unique|its very own} line - {much easier|much simpler} to read {!|.}
The {much better|better|far better} readability and {structure|format|arrangement} of {block spinning|the block spinning format} {give you|provide you with|offer you|provide} a {great|excellent|good|wonderful} overview {of your|of one's|of the} {text|article} and {decrease|reduce|lower} {errors|mistakes|faults}.
